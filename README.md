# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


#how to get it up and running

1. Clone the repo from github
2. Then cd into the cloned folder and write ```npm install vite --save-dev``` to install vite into the folder as a dependency.
3. Finally, write ```npm start``` and it will be done.
